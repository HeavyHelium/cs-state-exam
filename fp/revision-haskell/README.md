# Some remarks

## Useful URLs

## `.` vs `$`

- `$` is for avoiding parentheses, anything appearing after it will take precendence over anything that comes before

- `.` - function composition, i.e. we are tying the output of whatever appears on the right to the input of whatever appears on the left, the result is a function
